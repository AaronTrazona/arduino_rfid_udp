Arduino + RFID-reader on RFC522 module + UDP (Ethernet using RJ45 Cable)

# Materials
* 2 Arduino Uno
* 2 RFID-reader on RFC522 module
* 2 Arduino Ethernet Shield
* 2 Buzzer
* 4 220 ohms resistor
* 2 LED red
* 2 LED green
* 2 Breadboard

# Load the program to Arduino Board
Each arduino board has own code, For the 1st arduino board load the 111-ip code.
Once the code already uploaded into the board, check the serial monitor if the ip address is 111.111.111.111.

For 2nd arduino board load the 222-ip code. Same with the first board, check the serial monitor 
if the ip address is 111.111.111.222.
